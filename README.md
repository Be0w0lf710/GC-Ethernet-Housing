This project is for those who want to print there own housing for the WebHDx ETH2GC https://github.com/webhdx/ETH2GC project.  

Print with 100% infill and no supports are needed.

Network board is pressure fitted so all that is needed is to glue the housing together itself.  (hotglue or superglue both work)
